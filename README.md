# zsharpminor-flightsim-preliminary

Small prototype WebGL-based Flight Simulator using Three.js and particle generation. Work in progress!!!

# What's next?

Moving forward, I want to add obstacles, flaps, runways, landing gear, and adjust the speed values to make them more realistic, as well as modeling different aircraft! This was mainly a test to see if I could code a fully functional flight sim in less than 600  lines :)

# Credits For Code:

While the Three.JS code docs helped a *lot*, this project is **my own work**. 
Artificial Intelligence helped with smoothing the physics and a part of the CSS, but the rest of the work (90%+ is entirely mine).

Built for HackClub's Fudge Program, Tracked with Hackatime.

Built in Visual Studio Code for macOS.
